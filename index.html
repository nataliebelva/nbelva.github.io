    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Thank you for visiting the personal website of Natalie Belva. You'll find personal information, contact information, my resume, and work samples.</p>
    <p>I am a second year graduate student at the University of Florida where I am pursuing my Master of Arts in Mass Communication with an emphasis in Public Relations. Originally from Colorado, I spent my undergrad years in Virginia where I also enjoyed playing lacrosse for four years.</p>
    <p>Majoring in communications wasn't always my plan. I didn't go into college declared as a communications major, but I was enrolled in both a journalism course and media history course my second semester of freshman year and became so intrigued. Not soon after, I declared communications as a double major. Being a double major in school, there were quite a few classes I didn't have an opportunity to take in communications. I was eager to expand my knowledge and spend more time focusing on this field as I have a deep passion for all things communications related.</p>
    <p>Some of my experience includes creating strategic public relations plans, managing social media, developing marketing plans, writing press releases and other articles, writing and delivering speeches, conducting research studies, creating fund raising campaigns, and developing creative material.</p>
    <p>On a personal level</p>

<ul>
<li>Being from Colorado, I'm a mountain girl. I love exploring and experiencing the outdoors.</li>
<li>I'm from Colorado, went to undergrad in Virginia, and now live in Florida. I get plenty of weird looks and am asked a lot of questions, I guess I just like to explore!</li>
<li>I played lacrosse in college and it was definitely the best four years of my life.</li>
<li>I am the oldest of four kids and am an extremely proud big sister.</li>
<li>I love traveling. I grew up spending summers going to Yellowstone and Mount Rushmore so I appreciate the opportunity to go to new places.</li>      
</ul>
